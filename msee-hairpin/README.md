# Lab Expressroute MSEE Hairpin

This guide will help you to build a scenario for testing MSEE hairpin with ExpressRoute.

## Overview

MSEE hairpin is a scenario where traffic between two virtual networks in the same region or different regions is routed through the ExpressRoute circuit. This is a common scenario when you have a hub and spoke architecture where the spoke virtual networks are connected to the hub virtual network using VNet peering and the hub virtual network is connected to on-premises network using ExpressRoute.

## Considerations

## Intra-region MSEE hairpin

When you have virtual networks in the same region and you want to route traffic between them through the ExpressRoute circuit, you need to consider the following:

## Inter-region MSEE hairpin

When you have virtual networks in different regions and you want to route traffic between them through the ExpressRoute circuit, you need to consider the following:
